## Key Questions Before Starting the Dashboard 🤔

- What’s the objective of this Power BI dashboard?
- How will the success of this project be measured?
- What’s the project deadline?
- Do stakeholders expect a preview before the final release?
- What hopes and fears do stakeholders have about the dashboard?
- Who will use the dashboard, and for what purpose?
- What are the key expectations upon project completion?
- What could go wrong during development?
- What resources and data are needed for this dashboard?
- Are there any design or visualization preferences from stakeholders?

## Dataset Understanding 📈

Before diving into analysis, it's crucial to understand the available data. The dataset includes:

- **Dimension Tables**: Contain static data, like customer and product details.
- **Fact Tables**: Store transactional data.

### Example:
- **Customer Table**: 27 markets, 75 customers, with two platforms (Brick & Mortar, E-commerce)
- **Product Table**: Multiple categories and variants (e.g., Internal HDD, keyboard)
- **Forecast Table**: Monthly forecasted customer demand to enhance customer satisfaction and reduce storage costs.

## Importing Data into Power BI 📥

Since the database is in MySQL, the data is imported into Power BI by connecting via database credentials.

## Data Modeling 🏗️

Data modeling is the backbone of any Power BI report. Following best practices ensures optimal performance. For this project, we used the **Snowflake data model** approach. Poor modeling could severely impact report performance, so it's crucial to get this right.

## Dashboard Design 🎨

Based on mockups provided by stakeholders, the team designs visuals and creates necessary measures along the way.

### Home View 🏠

The Home view contains buttons for easy navigation to different sections:
- Info
- Finance View
- Sales View
- Marketing View
- Supply Chain View
- Executive View

## Project Outcome 🎯

With this comprehensive report, AtliQ can make data-driven decisions, answering numerous "why" questions that arise in various business scenarios. This tool is key to the company’s future success in a competitive industry.
